## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Knowledge gaps in reactive programming | High | Medium | Provide training, start with small components, pair programming |
| Database migration issues | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing, rollback strategy, staged migration |
| Performance regression during refactoring | Medium | High | Establish performance baselines, automated performance testing |
| Security vulnerabilities during transition | High | Low | Security scanning in CI/CD, regular penetration testing |
| Extended downtime during deployment | High | Low | Blue-green deployment, feature flags, gradual rollout |

To measure the success of the modernization effort, we recommend tracking the following metrics:

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Application startup time (target: < 2 seconds)
   - API response time (target: p95 < 200ms)
   - Memory usage (target: 30% reduction)
   - Throughput (target: 2x improvement)

2. **Developer Experience Metrics**
   - Build time (target: < 1 minute)
   - Test execution time (target: < 3 minutes)
   - Code coverage (target: > 80%)
   - Developer onboarding time (target: < 1 day)

3. **Operational Metrics**
   - Deployment frequency (target: daily)
   - Change failure rate (target: < 5%)
   - Mean time to recovery (target: < 30 minutes)
   - Infrastructure cost (target: 20% reduction)
